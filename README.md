# E-Commerce-Market-Mix-Modelling

Over the last one year, ElecKart, a leading E-commerce Company in Canada, has faced a revenue dip even after spending a significant amount of money on marketing and promotions. There was a high customer churn ratio because the company was failing to understand customer demographics and cater to the needs of their customers. There was no mobile app for a satisfactory shopping experience and the website had a confusing interface with incomplete product details making it difficult for the customers to easily locate what they are looking for. The budgets planned were not as impactful as expected, and the CFO was quite unhappy with the turnover rates. Now, the CFO wants a root cause analysis done to understand what went wrong in the process and why they were unable to hit the desired profit levels. The company would like to optimise its operations in order to ensure better cost efficiencies and not lose the existing customer base due to lack of planning and operational flaws.

Now, suppose you are working at an e-commerce service consultant firm, and you are tasked with understanding the problem and making recommendations about how ElecKart’s end-to-end operations can be optimised. You are required to spend a couple of weeks collecting facts and data about ElecKart’s operations and investigate this incident to find the possible root causes for the underlying issue.
